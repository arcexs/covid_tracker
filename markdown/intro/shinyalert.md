<h4><i class='fad fa-chart-line'></i> | New Economic Data</h4>On our "State Explorer" dashboard, we have included two new datasets available for analysis. The first is a visualization that shows the top 25 industries filing unemployment claims with the Texas Workforce Commission in the most recent reporting period. The second is a series of charts visualizing spending trends by industry type and consumer ZIP code type.</br>

<h4><i class='fad fa-hospital-symbol'></i> |  Hospital Capacity Data</h4>We are continuing to monitor new reporting for the state's hospital capacity data. As reporting continues to stabilize, we are planning to modify some of our hospital capacity charts to accommodate for new metrics being collected by the state that were previously not included in the data we received.
