## Special Acknowledgements

Often, it's said that everything's bigger in Texas. In difficult times like this, one of the more inspiring ways we live up to this mantra is through an incredible sense of community displayed among the many nonprofits, businesses, institutions, and organizations who interface with the Lone Star State. As such, Texas 2036 would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the outstanding help and generosity of those who have extended their time, consultation, expertise, and data to inform the resources organized here. That said, we would like to say a huge thank you to the following key folks:

### [**The University of Texas at Austin - Dell Medical School**](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/)

Throughout the develpment process, Dell Medical School has been a key provider of feedback in our effort to provide the most relevant and meaningful metrics organized here. As much of the research and what we know about COVID-19 unfolds weekly (sometimes daily), Dell Medical School has been a trusted thought-partner to process both new and old knowledge. As we continue to refine and update this pproduct, it goes without saying that we couldn't have done this without their help.

### [Homebase](https://joinhomebase.com/blog/real-time-covid-19-data/)

Homebase is a free scheduling and time tracking tool used by 100,000+ local businesses and their hourly employees. Homebase’s customers in the US primarily consist of restaurant, food & beverage, retail and services and are largely individual owned/operator managed businesses. Their COVID-19 dataset is based on Homebase data covering 60,000 businesses across the US (over 5,600 in Texas) and 1 million hourly employees active in US metropolitan areas in January 2020.

### [Convex Design](https://convex.design)

Convex Design is a small data-driven digital studio with expertise on everything from bar charts to neural nets. Their founders have worked with some of the most cutting-edge organizations out there. This includes helping scientists at NASA/JPL, neuroscientists at HHMI Janelia, journalists at CNN, FiveThirtyEight, and the New Yorker. As well as enterprise teams at Fortune 500 companies like AIG.

### [Safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/blog/safegraph-provides-cdc-fed-and-1000-organizations-with-data-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis)

SafeGraph has provided free access to its various datasets to help researchers around the world through its SafeGraph COVID-19 Data Consortium. So far, 1,000+ organizations are already in the consortium and are using SafeGraph and partner company datasets at no-cost. The data includes aggregated and anonymized datasets on social distancing and foot traffic to businesses. More details on the datasets here.

## Open Source Software Credits

#### [`censusapi`](https://hrecht.github.io/censusapi/) by Hannah Recht

`censusapi` is an accessor for the United States Census Bureau’s APIs. More than 300 Census API endpoints are available, including Decennial Census, American Community Survey, Poverty Statistics, and Population Estimates APIs. This package is designed to let you get data from all of those APIs using the same main function—getCensus—and the same syntax for each dataset.  

#### [`janitor`](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/) by Sam Firke

`janitor` has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.  

#### [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/) by JJ Allaire, Yihui Xie, Jonathan McPherson, Javier Luraschi, Kevin Ushey, Aron Atkins, Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng, Winston Chang, and Richard Iannone

The `rmarkdown` package helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and prose. You bring your data, code, and ideas, and R Markdown renders your content into a polished document that can be used to: do data science interactively within the RStudio IDE; Reproduce your analyses; Collaborate and share code with others; and communicate your results with others.  

#### [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) by RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.  

#### [`sf`](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) by Edzer Pebesma

The `sf` package is a comprehensive resource for analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing spatial data files within R. It works seamlessly within the `tidyverse` syntax and, thus, is compatible with a number of different `tidyverse`-friendly tools.   

#### [`tidycensus`](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus) & [`tigris`](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) by Kyle Walker

`tidycensus` is an R package that allows users to interface with the US Census Bureau’s decennial Census and five-year American Community APIs and return `tidyverse`-ready data frames, optionally with simple feature geometry included. `tigris` is an R package that allows users to directly download and use [TIGER/Line shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) from the US Census Bureau.  

#### [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) by Hadley Wickham 

The `tidyverse` is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The `tidyverse` package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the `tidyverse` in a single command. If you’d like to learn how to use the `tidyverse` effectively, the best place to start is [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
