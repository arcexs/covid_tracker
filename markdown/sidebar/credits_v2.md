## Special Acknowledgements

Often, it's said that everything's bigger in Texas. In difficult times like this, one of the more inspiring ways we live up to this mantra is through an incredible sense of community displayed among the many nonprofits, businesses, institutions, and organizations who interface with the Lone Star State. As such, Texas 2036 would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the outstanding help and generosity of those who have extended their time, consultation, expertise, and data to inform the resources organized here. That said, we would like to say a huge thank you to the following key folks:

### [**The University of Texas at Austin - Dell Medical School**](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/)

Throughout the develpment process, Dell Medical School has been a key provider of feedback in our effort to provide the most relevant and meaningful metrics organized here. As much of the research and what we know about COVID-19 unfolds weekly (sometimes daily), Dell Medical School has been a trusted thought-partner to process both new and old knowledge. As we continue to refine and update this pproduct, it goes without saying that we couldn't have done this without their help.
